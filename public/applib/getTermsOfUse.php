<p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the <a href="https://XX.eu" target="_blank">https:XX.eu</a> website ("XX-VRE") operated by the XX project consortium.</p>
<p>Your access to the use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
<p><strong>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, please refrain from accessing the Service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Access to the portal</strong></p>
<p>Access to XX-VRE and the applications hosted is free and unrestricted. Upon first access, a unique URL is generated to allow recovering of the data space in later sessions.</p>
<p>Users desiring a longer interaction with XX-VRE can register to obtain a permanent workspace. </p>
<p>XX-VRE uses Keycloak software to manage authentication protocols. For registered users access is  protected by a username and password combination, issued by XX-VRE itself. Alternatively, existing trusted Id providers like Google, openID, LinkedIn, and ELIXIR can be associated with the assigned username. </p>
<p>XX-VRE portal supports https access, which ensures encryption of all transferred data. Authentication protocols are applied transparently to all data transactions between the user and the Portal, either interactively, or through REST based APIs to assure privacy.</p>
<p>XX-VRE will be available for use except in the event of hardware failure, programmed maintenance, or on grounds of force majeure. When known, disruptions of service will be warned in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Protection of personal data</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Organic Law 15/1999 of December 13 on Protection of Personal Data, personal data used in the registration will be incorporated to a file property of the XX Consortium and will be treated in a confidential way. Use of this file is restricted to the needs of XX-VRE and its contents will not be shared with third parties. Use of this file is restricted to the needs of XX-VRE and its contents will not be shared with third parties.  We remind you that at any time you may exert your rights of access, modification, cancellation or opposition by contacting XX Coordinator at XX institute in writing (XX institute, c/ XX , 0000 City) or by e-mail (<a href="mailto:XX@XX">XX@XX</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Execution environment</strong></p>
<p><strong>XX-VRE</strong> is running in a series of cloud infrastructures based at XX partners premises (XX, XX). Physical compute clusters hosting the cloud infrastructures are physically protected and follows the security standards of hosting institutions. Direct access to the cluster are reserved to technical staff. Data transmission necessary for the internal activity of XX-VRE will use in all cases secure protocols (https, sftp).</p>
<p>Tools provided within XX-VRE are recognized in the field, and supported by their developers. XX-VRE may not offer the full functionality of the included tools, in comparison with their standalone versions. Details of the available functionality and the appropriate references can be found in the corresponding documentation section.</p>
<p><strong>Users’ data</strong></p>
<p>Our Service allows users to upload, and store information, research data, or other material, perform analyses on it, and download results. Additionally, XX-VRE allows to access selected public data repositories. </p>
<p>User’s data and results obtained (since they are generated automatically without human intervention) are treated as confidential and remain the intellectual property of the user.</p>
<p>User’s data is held in a private virtual workspace. Unless agreed in other terms, users’ workspace is limited to XXGB storage size, and is maintained until termination of users’ relationship with XX. For unregistered users, data is held XX days after the last connection. For registered users, in case of long term inactivity (XX months), XX reserves the right to archive users’ data and release the used storage. </p>
<p>Data held in the workspace is only accessible by its owner, although admin operations staff may be requested to access it to solve eventual operational issues. When necessary, a confidentiality agreement may be formalized. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the required agreement is in place prior to uploading any confidential data. </p>
<p>Backup of users’ data is performed periodically following the internal policies of the hosting institutions. XX-VRE or the hosting institutions cannot be held liable for data loss in users’ workspace. Users are advised to keep a local copy of any data uploaded or produced by XX-VRE.</p>
<p>When necessary specific confidentiality agreements can be formalized.</p>
<p><strong>Right of Modification</strong></p>
<p>XX-VRE reserves the right to make any modification in the interface, available tools, or provided data to fix possible bugs, or extend or improve the functionality. Users will be warned in advance about any modifications that may alter user experience. When possible, back compatibility will be maintained.</p>
<p><strong>User support</strong></p>
<p><strong>XX-VRE</strong> provides support through two different channels: 1) A Scientific Forum where support on the use of tools or algorithms will be provided. Scientific forum requests will be addressed to tool developers and XX experts. 2) A HelpDesk to address technical issues.  Note that Forum chats are not held confidential. </p>
<p><strong>Tools selection and Developers support</strong></p>
<p>Tools included in XX-VRE are selected by XX's steering committee.</p>
<p>Inclusion of new tools  would require adaptation to the XX-VRE internal execution engine. Detailed documentation to do so is available, and XX-VRE staff will help as necessary. Failure to perform the adaptation will preclude the inclusion of the requested software.</p>
