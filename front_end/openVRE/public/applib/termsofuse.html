    <p class="P4">Tools and workflows provided within openVRE SPE are integrated and supported by their developers.

    <p class="P4">User's data is held in a private virtual workspace. Unless agreed in other terms, user's workspace is
        limited to 5 GB storage size, and is maintained until termination of user's relationship with openVRE SPE.
        In case of long term inactivity (6 months), openVRE SPE reserves the right to archive user's data and release
        the
        used storage.
    </p>
    <p class="P4"> </p>
    <p class="P4">Data held in the workspace is only accessible by their owner, although admin operations staff may be
        requested to access it to solve eventual operational issues. When necessary, a confidentiality agreement may be
        formalized. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the required agreement is in place prior to
        uploading any confidential data.</p>
    <p class="P4"> </p>
    <p class="P4">Backup of user's data is performed periodically following the internal policies of the hosting
        institution. openVRE SPE and/or the hosting institution cannot be held liable for data loss in user's
